Today, I’m walking you through Command Center Pro: Enterprise Project Dashboard — a powerful Notion template designed for teams managing complex projects across multiple tools. If you’re tired of chasing updates, losing sight of deadlines, or dealing with rigid project systems that don’t fit your workflow, this dashboard is built for you. It gives you flexible, real-time project visibility with multiple views and automation to keep your entire team aligned and your projects on time.",
    "feature_walkthrough": [
      "First up, let's dive into the multi-view project visualization. Command Center Pro offers Kanban boards for agile task flow, Gantt charts for timeline-critical dependencies, calendar views for resource planning, plus list and gallery views for different stakeholder needs. Here, you can see how easy it is to switch between these views to get exactly the perspective you need, whether you’re a project manager or a visual thinker.",
      "Next, check out the intelligent task filtering and personal dashboards. Each team member only sees the tasks and projects assigned to them, eliminating noise and helping everyone focus on what matters most. Plus, real-time status rollups automatically update project health as tasks are completed — no more manual tracking or guessing.",
      "Finally, Command Center Pro includes built-in tools for capacity management and recurring automation. It prevents burnout by balancing workloads and handles your standups, reviews, and check-ins automatically. The priority matrix directs your focus on high-impact work, not just urgent interruptions, ensuring your team tackles the right tasks at the right time."
