    "hook": "You just finished a meeting where everyone was fired up about next steps. Then... nothing. Two weeks later, you're digging through 47 emails trying to remember who was supposed to do what. What if every decision, every action item, and every meeting just... stayed organized? Let me show you how.",
    "intro": "Hey, I'm walking you through the Business Meeting Command Center—a Notion template that's basically a time machine for your meetings. Instead of hunting through email chaos, you get one searchable hub where every meeting, decision, and action item lives in perfect clarity. If you're running a team, managing client calls, or leading board meetings, this is going to save you hours every week. Let's dive in.",
    "feature_walkthrough": [
      "First up: the Centralized Meeting Hub. Watch this—I'm looking at the main dashboard, and everything's right here. Calendar view on the left showing all my upcoming meetings. Click into any one, and boom—full context. Meeting notes, who showed up, what we decided. No more Slack threads. No more email chains. Everything's in one place, and it's searchable. So if you need to remember why you made a decision six months ago? Just search 'pricing strategy' and you've got it instantly.",
      "Now here's where it gets powerful: Automated Action Item Tracking. See how each action item is linked directly to the meeting where it was created? I can assign it to a team member, set a due date, and watch the status update in real time. No separate to-do list. No wondering if Sarah actually got that task. It's all here, connected, and accountable. When Sarah marks it complete, the dashboard updates automatically.",
      "Then there's Decision Documentation. This is the institutional memory piece. Every important decision gets captured with the context and rationale behind it. Why did we choose that vendor? What was the reasoning? New team members don't have to guess—they can just read it. And when someone asks 'why are we doing it this way?' three months later, you've got your answer ready.",
      "The Multi-View Dashboard is beautiful because it works the way your brain works. Need to see everything by date? Calendar view. Want to organize by project or team member? Table view. Prefer a kanban board to drag tasks through stages? Boom—one click. You're not locked into one way of seeing your work.",
      "Meeting Templates save you so much time. Instead of starting from scratch every week, you've got pre-built templates for team syncs, one-on-ones, client calls, and board meetings. Each one's optimized for that specific meeting type, so your documentation is consistent, professional, and actually useful.",
      "And here's the thing about Attendee Management—you can track exactly who was in which meeting with multi-select properties. So if you need to find every meeting where you discussed the Q4 roadmap with your product team? Filter by attendees. Find it in seconds. That's organizational memory that actually works."
    ],
    "benefits": "Here's what this actually means for you: You stop wasting hours reconstructing meeting context. Action items don't slip through the cracks because they're tracked and assigned. Your team stays aligned because decisions have documented reasoning. And when someone new joins? They can catch up on months of decisions in minutes instead of asking 'why are we doing this?' for the hundredth time. That's not just organization—that's competitive advantage.",
    "cta": "The Business Meeting Command Center is $19, and honestly, if you're running a team and you're tired of meeting chaos, this pays for itself in the first week. Grab it, set it up—takes maybe 15 minutes—and watch how much clearer everything becomes. Link's in the description. Let's go.",
