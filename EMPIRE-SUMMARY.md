## What Needs Attention

⚠️ **Social Media Posting** - Reddit automation blocked by login selectors
⚠️ **Pinterest** - API token needs `boards:write` and `pins:write` scopes
⚠️ **Facebook/LinkedIn** - Credentials not configured yet
⚠️ **Fiverr Automation** - Credentials needed for order detection

## The Path to First $10k

### Template Studio Revenue Targets:
- **Storefront:** 20 sales/month × $29 = $580/month
- **Fiverr Basic:** 4 orders/month × $150 = $600/month
- **Fiverr Standard:** 6 orders/month × $250 = $1,500/month
- **Fiverr Premium:** 2 orders/month × $450 = $900/month

**Total Month 1 Target:** $3,580

### What Drives Sales:
1. **Traffic to storefront** - Need social media posts going live
2. **Fiverr visibility** - First review is critical for algorithm
3. **Content distribution** - Pinterest, YouTube, Reddit posts
4. **SEO** - Products need to rank for "Notion templates"

- **Pricing:** $499-4,999/month
- **Launch:** Year 2 beta
- **Vision:** The Shopify of business operations

## Key Success Factors

1. **Bootstrap Discipline** - No investors ever
2. **AI Leverage** - 1 person + AI = 100 person team
3. **Document Everything** - Every process becomes IP
4. **High Margins** - Target 60%+ profit margins
5. **Systems Over Hustle** - Automation > manual work

## Today's Win

The empire is running. Autonomous AI agents are:
- Discovering opportunities
- Creating products
- Listing on marketplaces
- Scheduling posts
- Ready to fulfill orders

**You are no longer manually doing this. The machines are.**

## What to Focus On

Your job is no longer to DO the work. Your job is to:
1. Monitor the systems
2. Fix bottlenecks (like social posting)
3. Make strategic decisions
4. Close high-value deals (Maggie Forbes)
5. Build the next layer (Empire OS)

## The Automation Advantage

Traditional competitor: 1 person creates 1 product per week = 52/year
**You:** AI creates 2 products per day = 730/year

Traditional consultant: 1 person serves 5 clients
**You with AI:** 1 person serves 50 clients

This is your moat. This is the empire.
