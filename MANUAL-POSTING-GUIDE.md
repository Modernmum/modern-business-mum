# Manual Posting Guide - Get Your First Sales TODAY

Reddit's API setup is being blocked by captcha. No problem - manual posting is actually BETTER for your first posts.

## Why Manual Posting Works

- Looks more authentic and genuine
- You can respond to comments immediately
- Build relationships in communities
- No bot detection issues
- Gets you sales FASTER

## Step 1: Choose Your Best 3 Products

Go to https://modernbusinessmum.com and pick your 3 best-looking templates.

I recommend:
- 1 business template (Client CRM, Project Dashboard, or SOP Library)
- 1 finance template (Budget Tracker or Investment Portfolio)
- 1 versatile template (Meeting Notes or OKR Tracker)

## Step 2: Write Reddit Posts (Use AI)

For each product, go to ChatGPT or Claude and say:

```
Write a helpful Reddit post for r/Notion about this Notion template:

[Product name]
[Brief description]
Price: $29

Make it genuine, helpful, and not salesy. Focus on the problem it solves.
```

## Step 3: Post to These Subreddits

### For Business Templates:
- r/Notion (2M members)
- r/productivity (1.5M members)
- r/Entrepreneur (3M members)

### For Finance Templates:
- r/Notion
- r/personalfinance (17M members)
- r/FinancialPlanning (400K members)

## Step 4: Posting Schedule

**Today:**
- Post 1 product to r/Notion (10am-12pm is best)
- Wait 4 hours
- Post different product to r/productivity (2pm-4pm)

**Tomorrow:**
- Post 3rd product to r/Entrepreneur (morning)
- Post 1st product to r/personalfinance (if finance template)

**Important:** Reddit hates spam. Space out posts by at least 4 hours.

## Step 5: Post Format That Works

```markdown
[Helpful, specific title - NOT "Check out my template"]

Example good titles:
- "Built a Notion CRM for solopreneurs - sharing it here"
- "Notion budget tracker that actually helped me save $5k"
- "How I organize all my client projects in one Notion dashboard"

Body:
[1-2 paragraphs about the problem and solution]
[Screenshot or demo if possible]
[Soft CTA like "I'm selling it for $29 if anyone's interested"]
[Link to modernbusinessmum.com]
```

## Step 6: Engage With Comments

This is CRITICAL for sales:

- Respond to every comment within 1 hour
- Answer questions thoroughly
- Offer help beyond just buying
- Share tips and advice
- Build trust

People buy from people they trust.

## Example Post (Copy This Structure)

**Title:** "Built a Notion template to track all my Fiverr client projects - thought I'd share"

**Body:**
```
I run a small design business on Fiverr and was juggling 10+ clients in random Notion pages. Total chaos.

Built this Client CRM template to keep everything organized:
• Client info and communication history
• Project timelines and deliverables
• Invoice tracking
• Notes from every interaction

It's saved me probably 5 hours a week just in "where did I put that?" time.

Made it into a template if anyone else runs a small service business: [link to modernbusinessmum.com]

Happy to answer questions about the setup!
```

**Why this works:**
- Tells a relatable story
- Shows real benefit ($5hr/week)
- Not pushy about selling
- Offers to help

## Expected Results

**First 24 hours:**
- 50-200 upvotes (if post is good)
- 10-30 comments
- 100-500 clicks to your site
- **1-5 sales** ($29-145 revenue)

**First week:**
- Multiple posts across subreddits
- More engagement and credibility
- **10-20 sales** ($290-580 revenue)

## Pro Tips

1. **Post in the morning** (9am-11am PST) - highest engagement
2. **Use screenshots** - visual posts get 3x more clicks
3. **Be authentic** - share your real story
4. **Don't spam** - quality over quantity
5. **Engage** - respond to every single comment

## What NOT to Do

❌ "Buy my template!" posts
❌ Posting same thing to 10 subreddits in 1 hour
❌ Ignoring comments
❌ Being defensive when people criticize
❌ Only talking about your product

## Track Your Results

For each post, note:
- Subreddit
- Time posted
- Upvotes after 24 hours
- Comments
- Website clicks (check dashboard)
- Sales

This tells you what works.

## Next Steps After First Sales

Once you get 5-10 sales manually:
1. Get testimonials/reviews
2. Add social proof to website
3. Post success story on Reddit
4. Try other platforms (ProductHunt, Twitter)

## The Reality

Manual posting for your first 10-20 sales is SMART:
- Validates your products
- Builds community
- Gets feedback
- Creates authentic presence
- Drives real sales

Once you have traction, THEN automate.
