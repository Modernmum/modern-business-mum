    <title>Health & Wellness t-shirt - ** "Wellness in Motion" — positioned in clean, minimalist typography below the graphic, using a sans-serif font that feels contemporary and approachable.[5][6] | Modern Business Mum</title>
    <meta name="description" content="** A minimalist design featuring a stylized heartbeat line that gently curves into the silhouette of a person in a meditation or wellness pose. The graphic uses a warm, calming color palette with soft sage green as the primary color and cream accents. The design is positioned center-chest with subtle tone-on-tone embroidery details along the heartbeat line, creating depth without overwhelming the piece. The overall aesthetic blends hand-drawn warmth with modern sophistication, avoiding clinical sterility while maintaining professional appeal.[1][6]

Perfect for: ** Health-conscious Gen Z and millennial consumers (ages 18-35) who prioritize mental wellness, fitness, and preventive self-care. This includes yoga enthusiasts, gym-goers, meditation practitioners, and individuals seeking meaningful apparel that communicates their wellness values without being preachy.[1][2][5]

** This design capitalizes on the convergence of three major 2025 trends: the authentic mental health fashion movement that resonates with Gen Z's demand for introspective self-expression, the wellness-focused graphic design trend that replaces clinical aesthetics with warm, human-centered visuals, and the consumer preference for apparel that serves as both functional wear and subtle activism.[1][4][5][6] The soft color palette and minimalist approach appeal to customers fatigued by aggressive fitness marketing, positioning this as a premium wellness staple rather than typical gym wear. The tone-on-tone embroidery detail adds perceived value and craftsmanship, justifying the price point while maintaining the clean, modern aesthetic Gen Z demands.[5]">
