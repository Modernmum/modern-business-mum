    <title>Pet Lovers t-shirt - “Paws & Peace” | Modern Business Mum</title>
    <meta name="description" content="A minimalist, modern t-shirt design featuring a stylized line-art illustration of a dog and cat sitting side by side beneath a small constellation of paw prints. The artwork is rendered in soft monochrome tones (charcoal gray and white) with a single accent color—terracotta orange—for the paw prints and constellation dots. The overall style is clean, contemporary, and gender-neutral, with subtle texture in the background for depth. The design is centered on the chest, making it easy to print and visually balanced.

Perfect for: Urban millennials and Gen Z pet owners (ages 22–38), especially those who value simplicity, sustainability, and a modern aesthetic. Ideal for pet parents who see their pets as family and enjoy sharing pet-centric lifestyle content on social media.

This design taps into the growing trend of minimalist pet apparel, combining emotional connection with contemporary style. The “Paws & Peace” slogan speaks to the calming, joyful presence pets bring to daily life, while the subtle constellation motif adds a touch of whimsy and uniqueness. The monochrome palette with a pop of color ensures broad appeal and easy pairing with any wardrobe, making it a versatile, giftable, and Instagram-worthy choice for conscious, style-savvy pet lovers.">
