## Implementation Plan

### 1. Footer Addition to Template Studio

Add to bottom of storefront:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Need custom systems for your growing business?

Template Studio is powered by Maggie Forbes Strategies—
we help $3M+ organizations build intelligent growth infrastructure.

If you're scaling beyond templates and need enterprise-level
automation and systems architecture, learn more at:

→ maggieforbesstrategies.com

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Why this works:**
- Not pushy or salesy
- Self-qualifies ($3M+ revenue)
- Shows expertise (templates prove your systems knowledge)
- Natural progression for growing businesses

---

### 2. Email Sequence After Purchase

**Immediate (Purchase Confirmation):**
```
Subject: Your [Template Name] is Ready!

Hi [Name],

Thanks for purchasing [Template Name]! Your Notion template is attached.

Setup takes about 5 minutes. If you have any questions, just reply to this email.

Enjoy your new productivity system!

Best,
Maggie
Template Studio

---
P.S. If you're a business owner with $3M+ in revenue and need more than just templates—
like full growth infrastructure and AI-powered systems—check out my consulting practice
at maggieforbesstrategies.com
```

**Day 7 (Follow-up):**
```
Subject: How's [Template Name] working for you?

Hi [Name],

Just checking in—how are you finding the template?

I love hearing how people customize these systems for their business.

Also wanted to mention: if you're finding these templates helpful but need
something more comprehensive, I work with a select number of growing
businesses ($3M+ revenue) to build complete automation and growth systems.

If that's you, let's chat: [Calendly link]

Best,
Maggie
```

**Why this works:**
- Provides value first
- Natural follow-up
- Soft qualification
- Easy opt-in (Calendly link)

---

### 3. Fiverr Gig Description Addition

Add to the END of your Fiverr gig description:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ENTERPRISE CLIENTS:

If your business has outgrown templates and you need comprehensive
growth architecture—AI prospecting systems, multi-channel automation,
and strategic infrastructure—I also run Maggie Forbes Strategies,
working exclusively with $3M+ organizations.

Visit maggieforbesstrategies.com or message me for details.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Why this works:**
- Doesn't distract template buyers
- Self-qualifying (mentions $3M+)
- Positions you as expert (not just template seller)
- Creates authority halo effect

---

### 4. Fiverr Delivery Message Template

Update your automation delivery message:

```
Hi [Name]!

Your custom Notion template is ready!

[Template link and details...]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

CUSTOM SYSTEMS FOR GROWING BUSINESSES:

If you're finding these Notion systems valuable and your business
is scaling ($3M+ revenue), I also help organizations build complete
automation infrastructure through my consulting practice.

Learn more: maggieforbesstrategies.com

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Let me know if you need any adjustments to your template!

Maggie
```

## Qualification Triggers

### When Template Buyer Shows They're Ready:

**Watch for these signals:**
- Multiple template purchases
- Questions about integrations/automation
- Mentions team size (10+ people)
- Asks about custom enterprise features
- References "our company" or "our team"

**Response:**
```
It sounds like you might benefit from more than templates.

I work with growing businesses ($3M+ revenue) to build complete
automation and systems infrastructure through my consulting practice.

Would a quick 15-min call make sense to see if that's a fit?

- Over-explain consulting services
- Hide the connection (be transparent)

- Discovery calls → Consulting clients: Target 30%

- Average customer lifetime value: Target $200+

**Goal: 1 consulting client every 2-3 months from template funnel**
